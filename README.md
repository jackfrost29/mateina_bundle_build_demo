# Mateina clone site for demonstration purpose

The project is an attempt to clone the Canadian e-commerce website MATEINA, which sells Yerba Mate drinks (along with other accessories. The target of this project was to construct the "BUILD YOUR BUNDLE" section from scratch.

Please view the website in this link (https://mateina.ca/collections/build-your-bundle)

The Build your bundle section was written in "react.js" library. The UI for the "BUILD YOUR BUNDLE" section was written inside "BuildSection" component. In order to handle the complex states structure and data flow in the BuildSection, useReducer hook was used.

Please note that the project is incomplete and mainly for demonstration purpose. The checkout drawer section that opens after clicking the "CHECKOUT" button, the header navigation panel and other things are not functional in the project and mainly there for demonstration purpose.
